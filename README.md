# Rainfall-Prediction-in-Singapore
ST4248 Term Paper

# About
Although Singapore is not fortunate enough to experience the four different seasons as we are located near the equator, we do experience two monsoon seasons: the Northeast Monsoon season occurring from December to early March and the Southwest Monsoon Season from June to September. With Singapore experiencing nearly an all year round of rain, I would like to predict whether it will be raining the next day in different regions of Singapore using current day data, and to determine the main indicators which affect whether it will rain the next day. The report will cover on the data pre-processing performed, exploratory data analysis, the different models explored, and conclusion.
